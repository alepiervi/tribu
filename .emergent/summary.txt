The trajectory details the resumption and reconstruction of a full-stack Agenzia Viaggi (Travel Agency) application. Initially, the AI engineer explored the codebase, identifying it as a React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database) application. After a brief initial assessment, the user provided a GitHub link, enabling the AI engineer to fully comprehend the complex multi-role system (Admin, Agent, Client) and extensive features like advanced trip management, financial reporting, and user management that were previously implemented.

Upon user confirmation, the AI engineer proceeded to completely reconstruct the backend (over 1000 lines) and then the frontend (15+ specialized components) based on the GitHub repository's structure and logic. After successful reconstruction and a comprehensive internal test, the AI engineer generated test credentials for all roles. The user then reported a detailed list of bugs and missing features across various roles, and the AI engineer immediately began addressing these, starting with backend API fixes and TripView components.

<product_requirements>
The user's primary requirement was to resume and rebuild an existing Agenzia Viaggi (Travel Agency) application exactly as it was previously developed. This application is a comprehensive, multi-role platform designed for managing travel agency operations.

**Key Features (as rebuilt):**
*   **Multi-Role System:** Distinct dashboards and functionalities for Administrators (total control), Travel Agents (manage clients and trips), and Clients (personal trip area).
*   **Advanced Trip Management:** Supports various trip types (Cruises, Resorts, Tours, Custom trips), detailed day-by-day itineraries, specific cruise details (ships, cabins, ports, schedules), Points of Interest (POIs) with categories, client photo uploads, and personalized daily notes.
*   **Professional Administrative System:** Handles booking and practice management, automatic commission calculations (4% supplier), structured payment rates with deadlines, advanced analytics and reporting, and automated payment deadline notifications.

**Current State & Recent User Feedback (Bugs/Missing Features):**
After reconstruction and credential generation, the user reported several critical issues and feature gaps:
*   **Admin/Agent:** Inability to modify itinerary/cruise info in trip details, non-functional financial reports (with specific requirements for annual/monthly breakdowns including gross revenue, commissions, discounts, agent-specific commissions), client not found error in user detail, inability to create/save financial sheets, and trips remaining in draft status.
*   **Agent Specific:** Financial reports should *not* be exportable to Excel.
*   **Client:** Photo field needs removal from trip details (all levels), my notes lacks edit/save functionality (notes must be visible to agent/admin), and itinerary is not visible.
*   **New Feature Request (Client):** Add a quote request field for future trips.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Architecture:** React.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI Frameworks:** React 19, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI (Shadcn/ui components).
-   **Backend Technologies:** Pydantic for data models, JWT for multi-role authentication.
-   **Deployment & Environment:** Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for process management.
-   **API Design:** All backend API routes prefixed with .
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure with a  directory for FastAPI and a  directory for React.



**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**
*   : This is the core of the backend application. It was entirely rewritten in multiple parts (4 main batches) to reconstruct the full FastAPI logic, including multi-role authentication, API endpoints for trip management (cruises, resorts, tours, custom), administrative functions (commissions, payments), analytics, user management, photo uploads, and notifications.
*   : This file was rewritten to establish the main React application structure, implementing complex routing with role-based protection and rendering the appropriate dashboard (Admin, Agent, Client) or login form based on user authentication and role.
*   : A large number of specialized React components were created/re-created in batches. These components form the user interface for all the application's features across different roles. Examples include , generic , role-specific dashboards (, , ),  (for creating/editing trips),  (for displaying trip details), , , and more. These components implement the UI logic, make API calls, and manage state.
*   : Contains shared utility functions, notably  for conditional CSS classes and a / implementation for UI notifications.
*   : These files represent the Shadcn/ui component library, providing pre-built, accessible UI components that adhere to the application's design system.

<pending_tasks>
-   Fix itinerary modification in trip details (Admin/Agent).
-   Fix cruise information modification (Admin/Agent).
-   Implement comprehensive financial reports (Admin/Agent) with annual/monthly breakdowns (gross revenue, supplier/agent commissions, discounts, client departures).
-   Resolve client not found error in user detail for User Management (Admin/Agent).
-   Enable creation and saving of financial sheets (Admin/Agent).
-   Ensure created trips move beyond draft status (Admin/Agent).
-   Prevent export to Excel for agent financial reports.
-   Remove photo field from trip detail (all levels including client).
-   Add modify/save functionality for my notes on client side, ensuring visibility to agent/admin.
-   Fix itinerary visibility for clients.
-   Add a request quote field for future trips (Client).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully completed the full reconstruction of the Agenzia Viaggi application. This involved rebuilding the entire FastAPI backend, including multi-role authentication, advanced trip management, administrative, financial, and notification APIs (over 1000 lines of code in ). Following this, all necessary React frontend components (15+ specialized components like , , , , , etc.) were created or rewritten to implement the full UI and integrate with the backend. A comprehensive test was executed, confirming the platform was PERFETTAMENTE FUNZIONALE. Subsequently, test credentials for Administrator, Agent (x2), and Client (x2) roles were created and provided to the user.

The current work phase started after the user reported a list of bugs and missing functionalities across all roles. The AI engineer acknowledged these issues and has begun addressing them systematically, explicitly stating the first batch of fixes focuses on Backend API mancanti e TripView completo (missing Backend APIs and complete TripView). One file edit has already been successfully executed ( was edited as indicated by Edit was successful. following the plan for the first batch of fixes).
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the PRIMO BATCH of fixes, addressing missing backend APIs and completing the TripView component.
